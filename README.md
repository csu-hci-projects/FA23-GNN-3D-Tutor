# FA23-GNN-3D-Tutor

## Abstract
GNN-3D-Tutor aims to lower the steep learning curve of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Representation Learning (GRL) while exploring the use of Virtual Reality (VR) in Computer Science Education (CSEdu) through a quantitative study that measures, compares, and analyzes test results and qualitative feedback of participants exposed to either traditional lecture-based or experimental VR-based learning materials; supported by the “notional machine” pedagogic practice of the constructivism theory.
